\begin{itemize}
\item Designed from scratch a \textbf{High-Throughput Data Streaming Library} with minimal overhead above TCP to support smooth and fast flow of large amounts of data in \textbf{LVM Snappables}.\\[-1.9em]
\item Provided support for \textbf{pipelining of data transfer} to increase throughput which was essentially required in \textbf{High Latency} \textbf{Replication and CDP Links} where data transfer was occurring in a serialised manner using Apache Thrift.\\[-1.9em]
\item Used a T\textbf{hread-per-connection Concurrency Control} Mechanism and provided support for both \textbf{rewindable and non-rewindable} producers and consumers on a \textbf{secured duplex} channel.\\[-2em]
\end{itemize}

%The current methods for large data transfer in files or streams were computationally expensive on the host side and slow. Moreover, the data transfer in some products was taking place in a serialised manner, leading to low throughput, especially on the high latency replication links.\\
%My task was to \textbf{build from scratch} a \textbf{High-Throughput Pipeline-able Data Streaming Library} with a minimal overhead above the TCP to support smooth and fast data flow between two hosts. This library provided support to both \textbf{rewindable and non-rewindable} producer and consumers on a \textbf{secured duplex channel}.

\iffalse
\begin{itemize}
\item Designed a High Throughput Streaming Library for data transfer over a \textbf{Secured TCP Connection} as an API to user.\\[-1.9em]
\item Implemented a \textbf{duplex server-client stream} where each end can be a rewindable/non-rewindable   producer/consumer.\\[-1.9em]
\item \textbf{Designed} the response, request and error packet \textbf{headers} and the \textbf{protocol} to be followed from scratch.\\[-1.9em]
%\item Implemented \textbf{multiple classes in a hierarchical structure} and developed different utilities and wrapper modules.\\[-1.9em]
\item Used \textbf{thread-per-connection concurrency control} mechanism and maintained synchronisation between threads using \textbf{mutex lock wrappers} to avoid the producer-consumer and stream registration race conditions.\\[-2em]
